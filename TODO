- Add SIFS_DIR_ROOT
  This is the top level SIFS_DIR.
  I found myself wanting to reference a library sif file
  from within a nested SIFS_DIR but all I had was $SIFS_DIR
  which was nested.  I could have said $SIFS_DIR/.. but that is ugly.
  If we have a root, then we can specify a path to any nested
  SIFS_DIR we choose.
- .sil
  Simple include library file.
  Convention would be to namespace your vars and functions.
  Classic example would be postgres (PG_, pg_, pg.) and mysql 
  (MY_, my_, my.)
  Also, you generally don't set a home directory for a sil file
  and it won't show up when you type c.  Because it is assumed
  that it gets included via a sif file.
  We should have a routine for find sil's so we can see them.
  'l' ?
  Another example besides pg and mysql is my rails helper functions
  rfind, rgrep etc

- Tidy up the reference.txt; 'c' is badly written
- DEFAULT_SIFS_DIR so that when I first log in it automatically
  selects the one I normally use when I type 'c'.
- Get rid of r and rc??
  See 28-Aug and conventions for referencing sifs files in general.
  Should we just be able to . a sif and expect it to work?
  Commands like 'sif' won't work in this instance.
  But it would be easy to source in sifs.sh so that they do.
- Treat symbolic links in SIFS_DIR like directories.
- c "path/to/file.sif" doesn't use 'd'.
  This also relates to the way c.include works and the r/rc debate.
- Looks like we source sifs.sh every time we change a sif file.
  Is that desirable?
- glob the 'g' command?
  g <pattern>
  will try to match an existing mark (m <pattern>).
  If not, it globs.

- BUG: we don't popd when we change to a sif file.
  DONE 30-Aug-09
- Set up DEFAULT_SIFS_DIR which will get used with 
  SIFS_DIR is blank/not set.
28-Aug-09
- Add '..' on 'c' command to pop up a level.
  DONE 29-Aug-09
- Add sif history and 'j' command
  Sif history keeps track of previous sif files included
  into shell; j allows you to jump between them without
  updating this history
  DONE 29-Aug-09
- Decide on convention for sif files in general: do we 
  require that you can just . sif file? Or do we require that
  you load the sif machinery first like with an interactive
  session?
  Are there any instances where we need a full sifs environment
  when running stuff in one sif file in batch mode?
  - the 'sif <name>' command can use a shorthand that relies
    on SIFS_DIR.  'c <name>' requires a full name (but for 
    some reason sets SIFS_DIR anyway).
