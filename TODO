- BUG: we don't popd when we change to a sif file.
  DONE 30-Aug-09
- Set up DEFAULT_SIFS_DIR which will get used with 
  SIFS_DIR is blank/not set.

- Add '..' on 'c' command to pop up a level.
  DONE 29-Aug-09
- Add sif history and 'j' command
  Sif history keeps track of previous sif files included
  into shell; j allows you to jump between them without
  updating this history
  DONE 29-Aug-09
- Decide on convention for sif files in general: do we 
  require that you can just . sif file? Or do we require that
  you load the sif machinery first like with an interactive
  session?
  Are there any instances where we need a full sifs environment
  when running stuff in one sif file in batch mode?
  - the 'sif <name>' command can use a shorthand that relies
    on SIFS_DIR.  'c <name>' requires a full name (but for 
    some reason sets SIFS_DIR anyway).
