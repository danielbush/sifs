- get rid of 'd' and sifs.conf; instead, use symlinking
  to add other repos.
  I like the idea of having less moving parts.
- FIXME: can we handle symlink files? at the moment we can handle
  symlink directories.

- cl uses find to locate sif files in LOCAL_SIRS_ROOT
  This would be set by a normal sif file.
  If not set, cl does the 'find' in '.'.
  You might use a local sif file if it is closely tied
  to a project and its code rather than have it centralised
  in a SIFS_DIR.

- a default sif file cf DEFAULT_SIFS_DIR
- 'sif' command doesn't seem to update the 'j' command
- sifs.lib.glob
  Create a lib area for useful routines that I migth want to 
  use in shell scripts and sif files.
- local sif files
  we could temporarily attach them to the current sifs_dir
  via a symbolic link.
  SIFS_ATTACH_DIR=$SIFS_DIR/attach
  How do we know about these local sif files if they're not
  permanently in a SIFS_DIR?  Answer: because they are probably
  referenced and set up via a sif in SIFS_DIR.
  - cl | c.local | clocal | sifs.local
    - just . the file, but don't change SIFS_*
    - type 'i' to get back to previous sif
  - sifs.attach
  - sifs.detach

- anonymous sif files
  - create /tmp/$$.sif
  - switch to it
  - option to safe as a sif in SIFS_DIR
- sil redux
  - store sils anywhere within SIFS_DIR
  - sil to load them
  - sil.ls to list them

- Add SIFS_DIR_ROOT
  This is the top level SIFS_DIR.
  I found myself wanting to reference a library sif file
  from within a nested SIFS_DIR but all I had was $SIFS_DIR
  which was nested.  I could have said $SIFS_DIR/.. but that is ugly.
  If we have a root, then we can specify a path to any nested
  SIFS_DIR we choose.
- .sil
  Simple include library file.
  Convention would be to namespace your vars and functions.
  Classic example would be postgres (PG_, pg_, pg.) and mysql 
  (MY_, my_, my.)
  Also, you generally don't set a home directory for a sil file
  and it won't show up when you type c.  Because it is assumed
  that it gets included via a sif file.
  We should have a routine for find sil's so we can see them.
  'l' ?
  Another example besides pg and mysql is my rails helper functions
  rfind, rgrep etc

- Tidy up the reference.txt; 'c' is badly written
- DEFAULT_SIFS_DIR so that when I first log in it automatically
  selects the one I normally use when I type 'c'.
- Get rid of r and rc??
  See 28-Aug and conventions for referencing sifs files in general.
  Should we just be able to . a sif and expect it to work?
  Commands like 'sif' won't work in this instance.
  But it would be easy to source in sifs.sh so that they do.
- Treat symbolic links in SIFS_DIR like directories.
- c "path/to/file.sif" doesn't use 'd'.
  This also relates to the way c.include works and the r/rc debate.
- Looks like we source sifs.sh every time we change a sif file.
  Is that desirable?
- glob the 'g' command?
  g <pattern>
  will try to match an existing mark (m <pattern>).
  If not, it globs.

- BUG: we don't popd when we change to a sif file.
  DONE 30-Aug-09
- Set up DEFAULT_SIFS_DIR which will get used with 
  SIFS_DIR is blank/not set.
28-Aug-09
- Add '..' on 'c' command to pop up a level.
  DONE 29-Aug-09
- Add sif history and 'j' command
  Sif history keeps track of previous sif files included
  into shell; j allows you to jump between them without
  updating this history
  DONE 29-Aug-09
- Decide on convention for sif files in general: do we 
  require that you can just . sif file? Or do we require that
  you load the sif machinery first like with an interactive
  session?
  Are there any instances where we need a full sifs environment
  when running stuff in one sif file in batch mode?
  - the 'sif <name>' command can use a shorthand that relies
    on SIFS_DIR.  'c <name>' requires a full name (but for 
    some reason sets SIFS_DIR anyway).
