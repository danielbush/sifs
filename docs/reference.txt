  hh           Output this help message.
  i            Re-source the current include file and print its location
  d            Select a sifs location by setting SIFS_DIR. 'c' will run this
               automatically if SIFS_DIR is not set.
  c            Source an include file from SIFS_DIR
  sif [name]   Tries to intelligently load a sif file into the current
               shell (either interactive or batch mode).
               If you've already selected a SIFS_DIR, then you can
               invoke a name of a sif file within SIFS_DIR simply as
                 sif [name] 
               where file is [name].sif .
               However, 'sif' will look for all variants:
                 [name].sif
                 [name]  # Assumes the user has suffixed with .sif.
                 SIFS_DIR/[name].sif
                 SIFS_DIR/[name]
  c [name]     At the moment, this is the raw routine called by 'sif'.
               [name] has to be absolute and include the .sif suffix.
  e            Edit the current included file.
  r            Reset sifs and your shell; basically set HOME to OLD_HOME (your original HOME).
  rc           shortcut for running 'r' then 'c'; use this to change to a sif
               file in a different sif repo to your current one.

  The following g/m functions are to help you jump about from one location to another.
  m <char>     store current directory in a variable \$STASH_<char>
  m -          clear (unset) all \$STASH_<char>
  g            view all STASH variables
  g <char>     cd to \$STASH_<char>
  gg           Go to STASH_LAST; STASH_LAST is set to your current location by 'g <char>' command
               prior to moving you.
  If you've enabled dot_commands (default) and bash supports 
  command_not_found_handle(), then you will also have the following shortcuts:
  .<char>      same as: g <char>
  ,<char>      same as: m <char>

  sifs.go                    - cd to SIFS_HOME 
  sifs.dir                   - cd to SIFS_DIR  (if you want to delete a file etc)
  sifs.conf                  - Edit SIFS_CONF
  sifs.template [file_name]  - Create a sif file from template in current directory
  sifs.edit                  - Edit the SIFS_HOME/sifs.sh
  sifs.add file_name         - runs sifs.template and outputs to \$SIFS_DIR\file_name.sif
  sifs.ls                    - List .sif files in SIFS_DIR and any subdirectories.
                               Used by the 'c' command.
  sifs.mkdir dir_name        - Makes a directory under SIFS_DIR              
  sifs.up                    - Changes SIFS_DIR to SIFS_DIR/..
                               No checking is done; use this only if you have SIFS_DIR set
                               to a subdir of the "sifs.conf-defined" SIFS_DIR.
